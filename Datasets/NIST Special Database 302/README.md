# NIST Special Database 302

In September 2017, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) conducted a data collection event as part of its Nail to Nail (N2N) Fingerprint Challenge, designated as NIST Special Database 302.
The aim was to assess the capabilities of various devices deployed by participants to capture the entire nail to nail surface area of a fingerprint, equivalent to a rolled fingerprint, from unacclimated users without the aid of trained operators.

Alongside the deployment of Challenger devices, traditional operator-assisted live-scan rolled fingerprints were obtained, along with various other live-scan and latent captures of friction ridge impressions.
To evaluate the performance of Challenger devices, study participants also underwent fingerprint capture using traditional operator-assisted methods.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Biometric Training Team was invited by IARPA to oversee this aspect of the data collection, resulting in the creation of two N2N baseline datasets, with each participant's fingerprints captured twice by different FBI experts.

To ensure accuracy in recording N2N finger positions, plain fingerprint impressions were also captured in a 4-4-2 slap configuration.
This method involves imaging the four fingers of each hand simultaneously, followed by both thumbs, minimizing the potential for errors in finger sequence order.

During the data collection, four baseline devices (two rolled and two slap), eight challenger devices, and ten auxiliary fingerprint sensors were deployed, generating a collection of rolled and plain fingerprint images.
Baseline devices were required to achieve a 100% acquisition rate to validate recorded friction ridge generalized positions (FRGPs) and participant identifiers for other devices, whereas there were no such requirements for Challenger devices, some of which did not achieve full acquisition.

A variety of fingerprint impressions, including plain, rolled, and touch-free, were captured using multiple devices, along with sets of plain palm impressions.
Additionally, NIST collaborated with the FBI and Schwarz Forensic Enterprises (SFE) to design activity scenarios that would likely leave fingerprints on various objects.
These activities were chosen to facilitate the use of different latent print development techniques and simulate real-world law enforcement scenarios.
