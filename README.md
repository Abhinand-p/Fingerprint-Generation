# Fingerprint-Generation

The project aims to tackle the shortcomings of current fingerprint generation methods by introducing a novel fingerprint generation framework grounded in consistency models. 
It seeks to answer the scientific question of how to produce varied impressions of a single finger, accounting for variables like fingerprint type, acquisition device and pressure level.
This research is pivotal for improving the utility of synthetic data in training fingerprint recognition models, thereby reducing reliance on sensitive personal data.

This project serves as a submission for the Generative Neural Network for the Sciences course at Heidelberg University.
