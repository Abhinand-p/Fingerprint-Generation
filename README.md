# Fingerprint-Generation

The project aims to address the problem of fingerprint generation methods through various generative approaches.
It seeks to answer the scientific question of how to produce varied impressions of a single finger, 
while accounting for variables such as fingerprint type, acquisition device, and pressure level. 
This research is pivotal for enhancing the utility of synthetic data in training fingerprint recognition models, 
thereby reducing reliance on sensitive personal data.

This project serves as a submission for the Generative Neural Network for the Sciences course at Heidelberg University.
